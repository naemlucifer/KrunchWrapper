# 🚀 KrunchWrapper: Intelligent Compression Proxy for LLM APIs

![KrunchWrapper Overview](images/Screenshot-1)

KrunchWrapper is a high-performance compression proxy that connects your applications to large language model (LLM) APIs. It intelligently compresses prompts, reducing token count, while ensuring full compatibility with OpenAI APIs. 

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Dynamic Compression
- **Content-Agnostic Analysis**: Analyzes prompts in real-time to identify effective compression patterns.
- **Model-Aware Validation**: Utilizes correct tokenizers (like tiktoken, transformers, and SentencePiece) to guarantee genuine token savings.
- **Multi-Pass Optimization**: Offers advanced compression with up to three optimization passes for enhanced efficiency.
- **Conversation State Management**: Preserves compression context across conversation turns to boost efficiency.

### 🔌 Seamless API Compatibility
KrunchWrapper maintains complete compatibility with OpenAI API, ensuring that your applications can easily integrate and function without disruption.

## 📦 Installation

To get started with KrunchWrapper, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naemlucifer/KrunchWrapper.git
   cd KrunchWrapper
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use the package manager of your choice. For example, with pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Proxy**:
   Execute the following command to start the proxy:
   ```bash
   python krunch_wrapper.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Usage
To use KrunchWrapper, simply send requests through the proxy. The following example demonstrates how to send a prompt:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/api"
payload = {
    "prompt": "What is the capital of France?",
    "max_tokens": 50
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(response.json())
```

### Advanced Options
KrunchWrapper offers several advanced options for customization. You can specify compression levels, conversation context, and more. Refer to the documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### `/api`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Sends a prompt to the LLM and returns the generated response.
- **Request Body**:
  - `prompt`: The input prompt for the LLM.
  - `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate.

### `/status`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Returns the current status of the proxy.
- **Response**:
  - `status`: Indicates if the proxy is running.

## 📝 Configuration

KrunchWrapper allows for configuration through a `config.json` file. Here are some of the configurable options:

```json
{
    "compression_level": 3,
    "tokenizer": "tiktoken",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

KrunchWrapper provides performance metrics to help you monitor its efficiency. You can access metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint. 

### Example Metrics
- **Requests Processed**: Total number of requests handled.
- **Average Compression Ratio**: Average ratio of tokens saved through compression.
- **Response Time**: Average time taken to process requests.

## 🔒 Security

Ensure that your API keys are stored securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your code. Use environment variables or secure vaults for storage.
