# Critical dependencies for KrunchWrapper server startup (must be installed first)
uvicorn>=0.27.0          # ASGI server that runs the FastAPI application
fastapi>=0.110.0         # Web framework for the API endpoints
aiohttp>=3.9.0           # HTTP client for proxying requests to LLM APIs
pydantic>=2.5.0          # Data validation (required by FastAPI)
tiktoken>=0.5.2          # Tokenization for compression analysis

# Additional core dependencies
toml>=0.10.2             # Configuration file parsing
requests>=2.31.0         # HTTP client (backup/compatibility)
pytest>=8.0.0            # Testing framework

# Model-specific tokenizer dependencies
# For comprehensive model support, install all three:
transformers>=4.35.0     # For modern models (Qwen, LLaMA 3, DeepSeek, Phi, etc.)
sentencepiece>=0.1.99    # For LLaMA 1/2, Mistral, Claude, Yi, ChatGLM, etc.
torch>=2.0.0             # Required by transformers for tokenizer operations

# Note: tiktoken (already included above) handles OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT-3)
# All three libraries work together to provide complete model family coverage
